## Visualizing parts of Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras andÂ Cats

This repo contains a notebook with code for visualizing CNNs using cats.

### Requirements:

- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [opencv](http://opencv.org/) (although it is only used for opening an image, you can use anything that can open an image as a numpy ndarray)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
